Yes you don't automatically have execution rights on both asm and corewar,
but you should know by now how to change that and be able to execute those
two proprely. So copy this folder in your home before playing around.

asm: reference assembler ./asm for usage
corewar: reference virtual machine .corewar for usage
Champions/: basic examples of champions

To use corewar with graphic mode i suggest you to use a fullscreen terminal.
