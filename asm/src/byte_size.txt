All registers have size 1
live - 5 bytes
ld - Indirect of 2, Direct of 4
st - Indirect of 2
fork -direct of 2. Maybe Directs are the ones with funny sizes (corrobarated by 2 files)

tomorrow go through all the instructions. The size of the instructions is messing with your indexing for the labels.
Fix that and you're done with all.
